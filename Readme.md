#Breakout Replica

In an attemt to solidify the basics of game development
in Unity, I will be recreating the 1976 arcade classic, Breakout.

### October 22, 2019
* Update logic that disables the bricks colliders so that it behaves appropriately in all collsion instances
* Decrease the size of the collider on the ball in order to reduce multiple collisions at "once"
* Learned how to call methods from another game objects script

### October 23, 2019
* I found how to get a gameObjects parent gameObject
* I realized that when the ball reaches max speed the behavior of the ball on collisions is not working correctly, it sticks
* The velocity on x does not remain constant... I am not sure what logic determines the x velocity but it seems to vary
